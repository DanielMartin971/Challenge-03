# Challenge-03 || Password Generator

## Description

This is the 3rd homework assignment from the bootcamp. What was expected was to create a password generator. The user would be able to pick how long the password would be and able to choose certain prequisits that would be applied into the password. If they wanted special characters, numbers, lower or uppercase letters.

## Installation

Used a template that gave us a starter HTML and CSS with some javascript already there but we had to do the rest of the js to make the generator work.

## Usage

To access the page you use its deployed URL to see the generator

## Credits

Also used some old code to look back on for ideas on how to create the generator and Jessica Hickman for giving me a simpler idea on how to apply the code in a array
